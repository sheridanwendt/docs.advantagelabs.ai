# Overview: AEO Onboarding

To properly implement and manage your **Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)** strategy, we need limited access to a few core Google platforms that control how your business appears in search results, maps, and AI-powered answer experiences.

These platforms are foundational data sources used by search engines and AI assistants (such as Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT, and other answer engines) to understand and trust your business information. Access allows us to:

- Ensure your business data is accurate and consistent across search surfaces
- Monitor indexing, visibility, and search performance signals
- Optimize structured data and content discoverability
- Track traffic and engagement from search and AI-driven results
- Diagnose issues that may limit your visibility or authority

We request only the **minimum permission levels** required to perform optimization and analysis. Ownership of all accounts and properties remains fully with you.
